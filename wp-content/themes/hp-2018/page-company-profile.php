                            <h4>A family owned and managed pump manufacturer</h4>
                            <p>
                                The shortest possible explanation of who we are. Founded in 1979 Hazleton Pumps, a family owned business located in Centurion, Gauteng, South Africa, repaired submersible pumps and electric motors for the mines and industries.  The harsh mining conditions in South Africa caused a high rate of failure of these repaired submersible pumps and this lead to the design, development and manufacture of specialised pumping solutions that are capable of pumping acidic liquids containing solids under various conditions.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The main cause of submersible pumps failing is due to the pump running dry and overheating.  This problem was overcome by filling the motor housing with oil serving two functions - to dissipate the heat from the electrical winding as well as to lubricate the bearings and mechanical seals. <br>

                                The motor housing containing the rotor and stator is separated from the discharge pressure of the liquid being pumped using a cantilever shaft design, with a double discharge volute and by applying the latest design software the Hippo Submersible Slurry Pump Range was born. 

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Manufactured as a standard from specialised materials such as 28% Hard Chrome casting for abrasive applications and Duplex Stainless Steel Alloys (CD4MCu) castings for acidic environments and with quality being a major objective all the HIPPO Submersible Slurry Pumps are manufactured to comply with ISO 9001-2015 and IEC 60079-1. <br>
                                
                                A customer centric approach is followed by building long-term, committed, sustainable customer relationships when specific, specialised pumps are designed, developed and manufactured in collaboration with customers in order to meet their individual, customized requirements with products that are reliable, low maintenance, sustainable, efficient and at a reasonable cost of ownership.
